# Queues

This repo consists of 2 types of Queues, Linked Queue and Array Queue.
The difference between them is that ArrayQueue is based on ArrayList, Linked Queue is based on LinkedList.

Both types have their pros and cons.

In this case, using LinkedQueue is better, since it doesn't require fixed memory, i.e it is flexible.

In general, most of the processes in ArrayQueue and LinkedQueue are pretty similar.

Moreover, I had this as one of my homeworks on my freshman year, might help other freshmen.
